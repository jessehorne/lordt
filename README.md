Low Orbit Ransomware Denial Toolkit

---

Lordt is a toolkit for protecting your data from ransomware. It makes storing and backing up data a breeze. It then monitors your data for unwanted changes and can respond instantly to threats, quickly executing your response plan upon detecting ransomware.

---

My mission with Lordt is to build a foundation that can help protect your data first and fight specific types of threats second. I aim to support multiple platforms eventually and will update the following details when more platforms are supported and as features are developed. Please be patient with me!
